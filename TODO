* add template-base FSM implementation.
* create dynamic threads pool ("free lunch is over" -- Herb Sutter), adopting to work load.
* thread-safe containters would be nice feature.
* consider migrating most usefull parts of code to BUtils; trying to add it to boost is also an option.
* it is a good idea to add releases of this code to sourceforge or github.
* add some handle for logging mechanism.
* implement signal handling thread with input queue and asynchronous processing.
* prepare for C++11 portage (auto_ptr->unique_ptr).
