25 add MultiLock which takes set of mutexes as parameters and locks them in proper order (i.e. memory appearance order) to prevent dead locks.
26 consider using futex() in System.
29 implement System::SharedPtr that allows casting non-const -> const and derived -> base, just as regular ptrs does.
30 System::SharedPtr<allowNulls>
31 System::OneInstance
33 create dynamic threads pool ("free lunch is over" -- Herb Sutter), adopting to work load.
35 thread-safe containters would be nice feature.
37 fix problem with Backtrace (bug in the glibc? check man's example program).
