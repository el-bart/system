21 add template-base FSM implementation.
25 add MultiLock which takes set of mutexes as parameters and locks them in proper order (i.e. memory appearance order) to prevent dead locks.
26 consider using futex() in System.
27 System::Exception*(where*, what*).
28 prepare macro for creating exceptions, that would take down file name, line number and call name out-of-the-box.
29 implement System::SharedPtr that allows casting non-const -> const and derived -> base, just as regular ptrs does.
30 System::SharedPtr<allowNulls>
31 System::OneInstance
32 System::Singleton::->
33 create dynamic threads pool ("free lunch is over" -- Herb Sutter), adopting to work load.
34 add method for returning name of exception, to the base class (via typeid(*this).name() call).
35 thread-safe containters would be nice feature.
36 static, thread-safe mutex/lock implementation.
37 fix problem with Backtrace (bug in the library? check man's example program).
38 prepare backend for running separate thread for handling signals (see: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2121).
